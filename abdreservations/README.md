# Welcome to ABDReservations

ABDReservations makes it easy to manage the checking in and out of equipment, much like a library! Here are some of the things ABDReservations can do:

* Manage your inventory of equipment, including storing serial numbers, manuals and other documents, and more.
* Present an attractive catalog of equipment, including pictures, so people can browse and search your equipment.
* Allow people to reserve equipment in advance, according to rules you set.
* Enforce rules on who can reserve what equipment, and for how long.
* Manage checking in/out equipment, including unique checklists for each item.
